                I don’t feel like I took full advantage every week of the freedom to apply what we went over. I mostly
                stuck to the readings
                code examples and team projects.
                <li>becoming more dexterous at exploring your environment</li><strong>Rating 4 </strong> My group took
                advantage of VS code live share and it seemed like we were always giving hints for using tools more
                effectively.
                <li>becoming a person who enjoys helping and learning from others</li><strong>Rating 4 </strong>This was
                new for me and I didn’t like it at first. I came to appreciate our team projects and being able to learn
                and share with each other.
                <li>using a divide and conquer approach to design solutions for programming problems</li><strong>Rating
                    4 </strong>I designed my program and broke it down into modules and a schedule that I could keep up
                with.
                <li>finding and troubleshooting bugs you and others will have in the code you write</li><strong>Rating
                    4 </strong>This was most evident with my newfound understanding of the browser debugging tools.
                <li>developing and debugging HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript programs that use medium complexity web
                    technologies</li><strong>Rating 4 </strong>This class has helped me explore the world of JS a lot
                more and use it in my web development. I have a better understand of and experience with DOM and local
                storage.
            </ol>

            Things that I learned that I need to work on.
            <ul>
                <li>Organizing my code so that I can better reuse code I have already written. </li>
                <li> Applying new techniques in several different ways so that I fully understand them </li>
                <li>Working in teams or with a partner when possible </li>
            </ul>
